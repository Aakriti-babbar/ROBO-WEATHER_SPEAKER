# ROBO-WEATHER_SPEAKER
So, here is my first python mini project "ROBO-WEATHER_SPEAKER" , which tells you about the real time weather condition,air quality index,local time,cloud condition,wind pressure of any city or country around the world.
The main feature of this project is "ROBO-SPEAKER",which means that whatever city will be provided as input, the ROBO-SPEAKER will speak the weather condition of that city.
